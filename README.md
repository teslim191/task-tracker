# TaskTracker
A simple Task Tracker with CRUD functionality built using AngularJS.
This was adapted from an introductory course to AngularJS by Brad Traversy. The major purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with Angular JS. I made some Modifications of my own like reducing the number of componnets used for ease workflow. The project furthered solidified my understanding of NestJS.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
